# Data Overview

- All data was scraped from the [Official F1 Results Website](https://www.formula1.com/en/results/2025/races)

- Data was scraped from all races years 1950 - 2024

- Specific scraping links can be found in the [raw folder README](data/raw/README.md)

### Final Analysis Data

- The final analysis data contains 3510 rows and 50 features. Each row represents a driver's aggregated performance across all races in a given season. Many of the features are engineered based on existing columns to improve machine learning and other analysis.
