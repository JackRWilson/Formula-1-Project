# Formula 1 Project

## Overview

Formula 1 (F1) is a motorsport competition in which ten teams (constructors), each with two drivers, compete against each other in a series of races to earn points that determine individual and team standings. 

The points system has evolved since the sport's introduction in 1950 and follows this timeline:
List of Formula One Championship Scoring
1950 – 1959	Top 5 finishers score	Winner earns 8 points
1960 – 1990	Top 6 finishers score	Winner earns 9 points
1991 – 2003	Top 6 finishers score	Winner earns 10 points
2003 – 2009	Top 8 finishers score	Winner earns 10 points
2010 – Present	Top 10 finishers score	Winner earns 25 points

The race winner receives the highest number of points while decreasing exponentially for lower finishing positions. These points are added to the driver’s individual total and their team’s total. After all the races are completed (~20), the driver with the most points wins the Drivers’ Championship, and the constructor with the most points wins the Constructors’ Championship.

Formula 1 is very dynamic. Drivers are constantly switching between teams, and old constructors are constantly being replaced by new ones. The competitive nature of F1 makes data analysis crucial for understanding performance trends, driver consistency, and team dominance. 

This project aims to compile and analyze historical F1 data to uncover performance trends among drivers and teams. By integrating data from multiple sources, this analysis will provide a comprehensive look at how driver and constructor performance has evolved.

## Data

This project uses data scraped from the official Formula 1 results website for years 1950-2024. It combines race results, starting grid, fastest laps, and pit stop summary to create a comprehensive dataset. This dataset is then cleaned even more to yield an analysis dataset.
